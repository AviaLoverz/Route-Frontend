# Stack: HTML CSS JS Jquery Bootstrap React 

## Overview

HEllO! This is the first repo in my journey towards a career in frontend web development. Every Frontend web developer must master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to deal with different libraries and frameworks as Jquery and React


Regardless of the programming language I use, two tools that every developer uses on a daily basis are the **command line** and **version control**. The command line allows developers to quickly and efficiently interface with their operating system and software. To begin, we'll use the command line to navigate the file tree and create directories and files. Later, we'll use it to install software dependencies and run servers, among other tasks. Version control is an approach to managing changes in files without the need to make multiple copies of those files. We'll learn **Git**, which is the most popular version control system. Git integrates with **GitHub.com**, a site for developers to host and share their code. We will deploy our first website using **GitHub Pages**.



## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:
* Command-line basics
  * Navigating the file tree
  * Creating, copying, and removing files and directories
  
* HTML
  * Semantic elements, tags
  * Attributes
  * Best practices: indentation, file naming conventions and directory structure
  
* CSS
  * Order of importance
  * Class vs. id
  * Selectors
  * Typography
  * Box model
  * Display
  * Positioning and floats
  * Color: hexadecimal, rgb and named
  * Flexbox
  * Grid
  
* Git & Git workflow
  * git clone
  * git add
  * git commit
  * git branch
  * git push
  * git pull
  
* GitHub
  * Create a repository
  * Deploy to personal pages

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What does it mean to be a full-stack web developer?
2. What is the relationship between HTML and CSS?
3. What is Git workflow?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Build and style static webpages with semantic HTML and CSS
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets, inline styles and embedded style tags
* Explain the "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets and implement the box model for HTML elements
* Explain the value of version control and use Git workflow to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating and deleting files and directories
* Execute live deployment using GitHub Pages

## Homework: Code Refactor

Take the provided codebase and refactor it to make it accessible. Don't forget the cardinal rule when working with someone elses code:
"Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it"
